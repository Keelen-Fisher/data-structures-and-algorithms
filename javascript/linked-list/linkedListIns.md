# Linked List insertion

## Challenge

- append
  - arguments: new value
  - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after

  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach and Efficiency

- This approach was a little different, not yet completed and will finish in the early hour of the next day. Did research on how to implement append function into linked list, also looked up before and after insertions.

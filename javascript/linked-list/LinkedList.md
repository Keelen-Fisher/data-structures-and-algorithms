# Singly Linked List

Create a Singly Linked Lists with classes and tests.

## Challenge

- Create a Linked List class
- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
  - Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

- The class should contain the following methods
  - insert
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

- includes
  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: Boolean
    - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

- to string
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
        - "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL

## Approach and Efficiency

- I took the approach of the instructor's demo code given last week as a way of building my template, then I continued to do research on Linked Lists and setting up it's class.

# Linked List kth

## Challenge

- kth from end
  - argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
  - Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
  - You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach and Efficiency

- This approach was a little different, not yet completed and will finish in the early hour of the next day. Did research on how to implement append function into linked list, also looked up before and after insertions.

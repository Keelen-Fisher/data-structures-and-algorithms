# stack-queue-pseudo

- The plan for today is to create a function that takes an string and checks for 3 types of Brackets, returns true or false depending on the string.

## Challenge

- Multi-bracket Validation.

## Approach & Efficiency

- We approached the problem by trying to develop a function that loops the a string that we created. We created conditional statements to check for brackets and return counter that is set to 0 to be true, if not, then false.

# Stacks and Queues

- The plan is to create stacks and queues with it's appropriate classes. Both classes need to have similar methods with peeks and isempty.

## Challenge

- Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency

- Adding in the instructor's notes from last Friday, the plans is to use the methods provided and implement them into my index.js.I plan to then search for the other method functionality. Also, reading the psuedocode algorithm for each method in the provided stacks and queues documents.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

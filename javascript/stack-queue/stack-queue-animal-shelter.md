# stack-queue-animal-shelter

- The plan for today is to create a class that holds only dogs and cats by using two queues.

## Challenge

- First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

## Approach & Efficiency

- We decided to work on planning the problem by creating the problem domain, test cases, where you're asking what are the dataTypes, how many are there, then moving over to visuallization by trying to understand how to develop the process between movement of queues. Decided that it was best to change the domain to 1 queue and move through the queue with the front and the back.

# Code Challenge: Trees

## Approach

- The plan is to create a new binary tree and binary search tree. It is also important to learn about traversing, adding, and knowing the otypes of orders. All of these methods are to be implemented in the trees.js file.

## Challenge

- Create a Binary Tree and Search Tree.

### Method:

- Node
  - Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

- Binary Tree
  - Create a Binary Tree class
    - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
      - pre order
      - in order
      - post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
- Binary Search Tree
  - Create a Binary Search Tree class
    - This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
    - Add
      - Arguments: value
      - Return: nothing
      - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - Contains
    - Argument: value
    - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency

- After Friday's Data Structures lecture, the approach is to use the demo code and search for methods
